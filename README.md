git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SpQuant-SNN.git
cd SpQuant-SNN
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

### Quick Start
To train an SNN model with SpQuant-SNN quantization:

```python
from spquant_snn import SpQuantTrainer

# Initialize the trainer
trainer = SpQuantTrainer(model, dataset, quantization_bits=8)

# Train the model
trainer.train(epochs=50)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = trainer.evaluate()
print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}%")


### Example Scripts
The repository includes examples for training and evaluating SNNs on popular datasets like **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10**:

```bash
python examples/train_mnist.py
python examples/train_cifar10.py


## Methodology

SpQuant-SNN introduces:

1. **Membrane Potential Quantization**:
   - Reduces the precision of membrane potential representation to as low as 2-4 bits without degrading performance.

2. **Sparse Activations**:
   - Utilizes sparsity in spiking activations to minimize redundant computations, achieving significant energy savings.

3. **End-to-End Pipeline**:
   - Combines quantization and sparsity in a unified framework for seamless training and inference.
